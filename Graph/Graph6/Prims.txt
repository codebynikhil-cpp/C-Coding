-- DS -- visited set, priority_queue<pair>, unordered_map<pair>

- insert the pair of < -1, src > in the priority_queue
- one by one remove the root element of the priority_queue
- if the root element is already visited then we will just continue.
- then we mark the root visited
- we store the weight of the pair in the answer
- upadate the mapping
- go to every neighbour of the curr element, and only add those which are non visited and have a better weight proposition.
